# Hi there! 👋 I'm a Computer Scientist in the making

I'm currently a 2nd-year Computer Science student at the University of Roehampton, passionate about all things tech—from building sleek mobile apps to tinkering with microcontrollers.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

Right now, I'm part of **Team Lexicon**, working on a project called **PeerRide**—a ride-sharing web application. We're developing it as part of our Software Engineering module, and it's a full-stack project that's pushing all the right buttons: real-world use case, collaborative teamwork, and solid code.

## 🧠 Interests

- 💻 Mobile App Development
- 🔌 Embedded Systems & Microcontrollers
- 🌐 Web Development (Node.js, Docker, MySQL)
- 🔒 Backend Systems & Architecture
- 🤖 Experimenting with everything CS has to offer

I’m always curious, always building, and always looking to sharpen my skills.
